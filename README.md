# RedM-NPM
RedM Native Player Menu.  
this is a work in progress to replicate 100% of the functionality of the original player menu using active datastructs, databingins and lists from the RDO decompiles.  
ANY work towards this code would be greatloy appreciated, if you see something you like.... take it. fork it. tell folks how amazingly useful you found this code.  
I'm a hobbyist, so dn't expect clean. expect functional.
