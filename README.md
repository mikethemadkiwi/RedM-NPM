# RedM-NPM
RedM Native Player Menu.  
this is a work in progress to replicate 100% of the functionality of the original player menu.  
Code uses active datastructs, databindings and lists from the RDO decompiles.  
The goal is to create a structure that RedM Players can fill to recreate private msgsing,  
player invites and simple player function for player menu and player pause menu.  
ANY work towards this code would be greatly appreciated, if you see something you like.... take it. fork it.   
Tell folks how amazingly useful you found this code.  
I'm a hobbyist, so don't expect clean. expect functional. Barely.
